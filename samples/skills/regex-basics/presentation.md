## Overview

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Implement basic regular expression syntax such as:
    - Literal strings
    - Escaped characters
    - Anchors
    - Meta-characters

:::

::: rau-slide-importance

## Importance of Skills

These skills are important for the following reasons:

- Basic regular expression syntax is the foundation of meaningful complex regular expressions that can quickly solve difficult problems in text manipulation.
- Correct application of regular expressions saves time by preventing costly manual text editing.

## Literal Strings

Searching for specific words or character patterns

``rockwell``

``1756``

Mostly trivial; could be done with basic find / replace.

Has one major caveat!

:::

### Searching for special characters

Regular expressions use MANY special characters (mostly punctuation) to MEAN something about the pattern or text. Such as:

::: {style="font-size:.7em;"}

| Character | Name | Meaning |
|:----:|:----------|:----|
| ``.`` | (dot) | meta-character, matches anything |
| ``(``, ``)`` | (parenthesis) | subgroup capture |
|  ``{`` , ``}`` | (curly bracket) | repetition iterator |
| ``\`` , ``/`` | (slashes) | escape characters |
| ``[`` , ``]`` | (bracket) | custom metacharacter set |
| ``^`` | (caret) | line beginning anchor or negation mark) |
| ``$`` | (dollar sign) | line end anchor |
| ``+`` | (plus) | 1 or more repetitions |
| ``*`` | (asterisk) | 0 or more repetitions |
| ``?`` | (question mark) | optional match |
| | I dunno | and probably others I've forgotten |

:::

### Escaping special characters

Because those characters are special, literal searches for them must be ESCAPED.

\

search: ``192.168.1.1`` ?

\

NOOOOOOOO

\

search ``192\.168\.1\.1``

\

``\`` 'escapes' the standard regex parser

::: rau-slide-question

## Question

How do you search for something with a slash then?

search: ``\log.txt``

[**ANSWER**]{.fragment style="font-size:1.5em"}

[search: ``\\log.txt``]{.fragment}

:::

## Anchors

Search for things that are 'anchored' by the start or end of a line

- ``^``, Beginning of line
- ``$``, end of line

\

**Examples**

- ``^1\.``,  first step of a sequence
- ``\!$``, sentences of exclamation

::: rau-slide-question

## Question

How would you find list items (``-``) that are inset by exactly four spaces?

``` markdown
- Colors
    - Red
    - Green
- Names (    - per Susan)
    - Susan
    - Clifford
```

search: ???

:::

## Question

How would you find list items (``-``) that are inset by exactly four spaces?



``` markdown
- Colors
    - Red
    - Green
- Names (    - per Susan)
    - Susan
    - Clifford
```

search: ``\s\s\s\s-``

::: fragment

![search without anchors](media/without-anchors.png)

Oh no! Extra match on line 6!

``` markdown
- Colors
    - Red
    - Green
- Names (    - per Susan)
    - Susan
    - Clifford
```

**Now with anchors!**

search: ``^\s\s\s\s-``

::: fragment

![search without anchors](media/with-anchors.png)

Success!

:::

## Meta-characters

Matches 'types' of characters

Makes for clean searches of certain character types

\

| Character | Character Type | Example |
|:----:|:--------:|:-------:|
|``\d``| digits | 0-9 |
|``\w``| word | a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ |
|``\s`` | whitespace | space, tab |

::: rau-slide-example

## Example: Meta-characters

Find incorrectly branded references to FactoryTalk:

search: ``Factory\sTalk``

\

Find all references to British agents:

search: ``00\d``

\

Find specific ControlLogix DC modules:

search: ``17\d\d-\sB``

:::

### Negation of Meta-characters

Matches anything NOT in the character set

\

| Character | Character Type |
|:----:|:--------:|
|``\D``| NOT digits |
|``\W``| NOT word |
|``\S``| NOT whitespace |

## Custom meta-character sets

- ``[abc]``	Only a, b, or c
- ``[a-z]``	Characters a to z
- ``[0-9]``	Numbers 0 to 9

These examples match one character.

\

To match multiple characters, you need one pattern per character:

``[abc][123]``

::: rau-slide-example

## Example: Custom meta-characters

Find references to FactoryTalk View ME and SE:

search: ``FactoryTalk\sView\s[MS]E``

\

Find references to British agent 007 and 009:

search: ``00[79]``

\

Find more specific ControlLogix DC modules:

search: ``17[56]\d-[IO][AB]``

![logix metacharacters example](media/custom-metacharacters-logix-example.png)

:::

::: rau-slide-question

## Question

Which IP addresses will this regex pattern match on?

search: ``192\.168\.[15]\.[78][24]``

\

::: fragment

| 192.168.1 range | 192.168.5 range |
|--- |--- |
| 192.168.1.72 | 192.168.5.72 |
| 192.168.1.74 | 192.168.5.74 |
| 192.168.1.82 | 192.168.5.82 |
| 192.168.1.84 | 192.168.5.84 |

:::

:::

### Custom meta-character set negation

``[^abc]``

Not a, b, nor c

::: rau-slide-example

## Example: Custom meta-character set negation

Find Rockwell processors that are NOT ControlLogix or CompactLogix:

search: ``17[^56]-[OI][AB]``

![meta-characters negation](media/custom-metacharacters-negation-logix-example.png)

:::

## Wildcard meta-character

The almighty dot!

\

``.``

\

It matches

\

[ANY]{.fragment}

\

[SINGLE]{.fragment}

\

::: fragment

CHARACTER

\

**This can be reckless and make false positive matches; use with caution!**

:::

::: rau-slide-example

## Example: Wildcard meta-character

Find all Rockwell controller products:

search: ``17..-``

::: fragment

![wildcard fail](media/wildcard-fail.png)

:::

::: fragment

![sly no](https://i.giphy.com/GR4eSMqDdovZe.webp)

:::

::: notes

The dot 'overmatches' here - it matches things that aren't correct. It's a character, but we would be better off matching a more specific character set.
