## Overview

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Implement advanced regular expression syntax such as:
    - Character Repetition
    - Capture Groups
- Demonstrate all previously covered regular expression syntaxes together for complex search and replace operations

## Importance of Skills

These skills are important for the following reasons:

- With complex regular expression usage, difficult text manipulation and searching becomes much easier.
- Correct application of regular expressions saves time by preventing costly manual text editing.

## Ranged Character Repetition

Sometimes you need to look for a repeating character / sequence. If you know what the range (number of repeated characters) will be, you can use brackets:

``\d{4}``

Matches four digits in a row: **0000** - **9999**

\

``\d{2,4}``

Matches two, three or four digits in a row:

- **00-99**
- **000-999**
- **0000-9999**

--

::: rau-slide-example

### Example: Ranged Character Repetition

**Match credit card numbers:**

``\d{4} \d{4} \d{4} \d{4}``

\

**Find IP address sloppily:**

``\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}``

![ranged repetition](media/ranged-repetition.png)

Matches good examples, but also INCORRECT ones!

We'll fix this in a little bit!

:::

## 'or more' Repetition

These allow for 'X or more' character repetition:

``*``, **zero** or more repetitions

``+``, **one** or more repetitions

::: rau-slide-example

### Example: 'or more' Repetition

**Find any unordered lists in Markdown, regardless of 'depth'**

search: ``^\s*-\s``

``\s*`` matches any repetition of whitespace characters (including zero):

![or more repetition list items](media/or-more-repetition-unordered-lists.png)

:::

## Optional Pattern

[``?``]{style="font-size:2em"}

Makes a pattern optional! Could be there, but okay if not.

\

Usually used with other repetition options (``*``, ``+``), but here's a simple example:

\

search: ``CLG?X``

Find **CLX** or **CLGX**,

*but not CLOX*

## Capture Groups

Capture groups allow you to define multiple characters, in order, as a set.

Anything within parenthesis is a group.

``(dog)+`` matches one or more repetitions of the word **dog**

\

**Capture groups are not the same as a character set!**

``[abc]``

(character set)

matches a single character: a, b or c

\

``(abc)`` 

(character sequence)

matches the sequence of characters: abc

## Why use capture groups?

Yes, you can just search for ``abc`` without a capture group,

but capture groups let you do so much more! Like:

- optional capture groups
- group substitution

### Optional Capture Groups

``(cat|dog)``

matches  *cat* OR *dog*

\

``(cat|dog)+``

matches one or more repetitions of cat or dog in any combination, e.g.

*cat, catcat, catdog, catcatdogdog, catdogcatdog*

### Using Capture Groups for Text Replacements

The COOLEST thing about capture groups is that you can refer to text in the capture group when doing REPLACE operations!

::: rau-slide-example

### Replace using capture group example

**Replace paren step numbers with dot step numbers**

search: ``(\d+)\)``

replace: ``$1.``

![replace with capture groups](media/replace-capture-group.png)

``(\d+)`` is the capture group: anything in that match can be used with the placeholder ``$1``

(i.e. the first capture group).

More parenthesis? ``$2``, ``$3`` ...

:::

::: rau-slide-example

### Another replace using capture group example

**Change quote styles in a document**

search: ``^(\w+):(.*)$``

replace: ``<$1> $2``

::: columns

::: column

**Before**

Tom: I'll get you!

Jerry: I don't think so!

:::

::: column

**After**

\<Tom\> I'll get you!

\<Jerry\> I don't think so!

### Create trailing blank line after list example

Consider the following markdown:

``` markdown
4 Day Class

    - ~3.5 days of instruction and/or labs
    - ~0.5 days for review and test
    - 17 labs (plus 2 extra optional labs for Oracle OCI)
    - Mini project
Take breaks as needed and inform instructor of any absences needed

    - Lunch will be ~12:00PM-1PM each day
```

and after

``` markdown
4 Day Class

    - ~3.5 days of instruction and/or labs
    - ~0.5 days for review and test
    - 17 labs (plus 2 extra optional labs for Oracle OCI)
    - Mini project

Take breaks as needed and inform instructor of any absences needed

    - Lunch will be ~12:00PM-1PM each day
```

### Basic regex example application

This regex uses two pattern groups. They are numbered in the order they occur in the regex.

search: ``\s\s\s\s-\s(.*)\n^([^\s\n])``
\
replace: ``    - $1\n\n$2``

### Better regex example application

Again, more accurate matching for any (or no) indentation, that preserves indentation:

search: ``(\s*?)-\s(.*)\n^([^\s\n])``
\
replace: ``$1- $2\n\n$3``
