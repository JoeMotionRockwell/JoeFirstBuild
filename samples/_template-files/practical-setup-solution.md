INSTRUCTOR SETUP

NOT TO BE SHARED WITH STUDENTS

:::

## Required Resources

List any equipment or programs that are needed to set up the practical equipment.

## Instructor Setup

List the steps that the instructor should take to put the equipment in the starting state for the student to attempt the practical. This would be things like:

- flash firmware to a specific version
- download specific programs to controllers
- set specific dip-switch settings on equipment

## Check Offs

### Intended Learning

What is this practical trying to teach / have the student demonstrate? What should the student be able to demonstrate to complete the practical? This is in a general sense; the actual steps to check off are listed further down.

### Instant Fails

These are things that the student should NEVER do. They should be explicitly called out in the practical information given to the student.

### Check Off Procedure

This is a list of steps that the instructor should be able to complete, or a set of things the instructor should verify on a student's equipment. Please be a specific as possible and include screenshots to assist.

1. Verify code
1. Verify settings
1. Verify functionality.
