## Name {.practical-h2}

::: rau-input-singleline

:::

## Scenario {.beforeBegin}

Describe the scenario. This should be what problem the (fictional) customer is looking to resolve.

### Expectations {.about}

Things here should be a description of what the student SHOULD or SHOULD NOT do during the practical. If you do not want them changing certain settings, or flashing firmware, include that here. 

### Intended Outcome

This should describe what the intended GOAL of the practical is. What should the student be able to do (or what will the instructor test). If describing what the instructor will test, be general enough to not give away answers in the practical prompt.
